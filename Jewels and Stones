Q. You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S 
is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a
different type of stone from "A".

Example 1:

Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3

Solution 

String J ='aA';
String S ='aAAbbbb';
Integer count = 0;

 for(Integer i=0; i < J.length(); i++)
     for(Integer k=0; k < S.length(); k++)
    {    if(J.charAt(i) == S.charAt(k))
            count++;
    }
     system.debug(count);
